# DN404 Factory ðŸ¥œ

[![CI][ci-shield]][ci-url]

DN404 Factory is a set of contracts built for the DN404 implementation that enables anyone to deploy their own DN404 contracts.

## Contracts

The Solidity smart contracts are located in the `src` directory.

```ml
src
â”œâ”€ DN404Factory â€” "Factory contract for DN404"
â”œâ”€ DN404Cloneable â€” "Cloneable contract for DN404"
```
